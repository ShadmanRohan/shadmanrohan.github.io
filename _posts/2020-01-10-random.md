Thank god I never got what I wanted early in life. I would have never done anything interesting.

My lack of success in early life has taught me
* the importance of grit
* to question societal norms
* seek happiness from the little things in life 
* view life from my death bed and live accordingly. 

I feel I can experience life in full spectrum now.
