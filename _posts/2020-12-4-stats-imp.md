Must know stats for ML practitioners:
1. Know what a p-value is and its limitations in decisions.
2. Linear regression and its assumptions.
3. When to use different statistical distributions.
4. How an effect size impacts results/decisions.
5. Mean, variance for Normal, Uniform, Poisson.
6. Sampling techniques and common designs (e.g. A/B).
7. Bayes' theorem (applied calculations).
8. Confidence intervals measurement and interpretation.
9. Logistic regression and ROC curves.
10. Resampling (Cross validation + bootstrapping).
11. Dimensionality reduction.
12. Tree-based models (particularly how to prune).
13. Ridge and Lasso for regression.
