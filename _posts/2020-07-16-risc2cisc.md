title: CISC to RISC
tags: [computer architecture]

RISC is faster, more energy efficient and easier to design. CISC uses less memory and is simpler for compilers. 

It made sense to use CISC in the 1980s, when memory was much more expensive, programming languages were lower level and compiler technology was not yet well established.
Nowadays, memory is no longer a limiting factor and modern compilers/interpreters can turn high-level languages into machine code very easily.
The priority now, with the mobile device revolution, is to design faster, less energy-consuming processors, and RISC is the way to go.
In addition, as they are simpler to conceive, the market's transition to RISC would greatly increase competition in this segment, which has been quite stagnated in the last decade. because of the Intel/AMD duopoly.
