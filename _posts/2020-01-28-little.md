I used to be the kind of person who enjoyed arguing. But recently I noticed there has been a shift. I am now happy to let others make mistakes and never point them out. I dont feel the need to analyze every statement hurled at me.

Life should be optimized for maximizing happiness and freedom. The rat race will be there whether I like it or not. I just dont want any part in it. 

That smell from an early morning tea, a sudden rain,  a well-made bed, that smile from a stranger...  is what actually matters more in life. I am finally learning to appreciate the little things in life. It feels good... or maybe I am just getting older.
