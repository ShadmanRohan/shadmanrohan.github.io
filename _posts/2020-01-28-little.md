Something inside me is changing. My perspective on how to live life has shifted. I am happy to let others make mistakes and never point them out. I dont feel the need to analyze every statements thrown at me.

I want to optimize life for happiness and freedom. The rat race will be there whether I like it or not. I just dont want any part in it. 

A sudden rain, early morning tea, a well-made bed, that smile from a stranger...  is what actually matters more in life. I am finally learning to appreciate the little things in life. It feels good... or maybe I am just getting older.
