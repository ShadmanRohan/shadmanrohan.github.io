I was very naive in my teenage years. Thank god I never got what I wanted early in life. I would have never understood life or do anything interesting.
My early life stumbles has taught me
* the importance of grit
* to question norms
* seek happiness from the little things in life 
* view life from my death bed and live accordingly. 

I feel I can experience life in full spectrum now.
