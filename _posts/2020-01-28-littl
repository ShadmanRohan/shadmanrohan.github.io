I am changing. My views on several major topics has changed a lot recently. I am happy to let others make mistakes and never point them out. I dont feel the need to analyze every statements at me anymore.
The rat race of life will be there whether I like it or not. I just dont want to have any part in it. I want optimize life for independence, happiness and 

That smile from a stranger, the rain, the sunset...  is what actually makes life more beautiful. I am finally learning to appreciate the little things in life. 

Or maybe I am just growing old.
